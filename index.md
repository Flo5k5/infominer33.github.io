## Introduction

**My aim: To create content of the highest quality, and relate complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion â€” supplying essential details, with quality sources for additional study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming, data science, web development, and to a lesser extent, quantum computing, VR, and other tech trends.

I'm also interested in science fiction book, movies, and other tech-related media.

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive repository of information surrounding the history of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, and DLT**

It's important for me to be as accurate as possible. I try to find people who know more than I do, and ask questions in chat or on forums, if I'm usure about anything.

I look for source-grade resources, so that people can follow the trail from whichever aspect of an article intrigues them.

## Research [**^**](#contents)

Organizing information in github repositories is a form of systematic study, and helpful for content creation. I've also given some of the more complete resources, within repositories, their own pages.

## Audio Transcripts [**^**](#contents)

I've taken to working on the youtube transcripts for podcasts and videos whose content is valuable and not readily accessible in text form, so its easier to reference.

## Crypto SuperSource Discord Server [**^**](#contents)

<a href="http://crypt0library.net"><img src="images/crypt0library.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I've been following top accounts in crypto: cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc â€” re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog.

Gradually, I go back over the re-tweets and organize all of the information (filtered with and accompanied by crypto-twitter's crowd-sourced commentary) in the channels of the [Crypto Super Source Discord Server](http://crypt0library.net). 

Of course I go back and forth, when writing, entering new links in one of the research repositories, and mining the repositories for source-grade information.

I've gradually been moving those links from discord to Github in TOML format, to become a database that powers a [dynamic web portal](https://github.com/infominer33/crypto-supersource).

As I fill up those TOML files, and depending on what has my attention at a given moment, or what article I'm working on, I begin placing the links in [github repositories](https://github.com/infominer33), to be more organized and accessible. From there, it's not so hard to spin up [github-pages](/notes.html) for it all.

If anyone wants to join in on the fun, you will be welcome ðŸ¤“

### Server Directory:

I'll share the server directory here, to give you an idea of what you're missing out on. It's quite navigable, using `ctrl+k` (in the discord app), or the channel directory I've made in-server.

## Services Available [**^**](#contents)

I create information-dense content and provide research consulting services.

### Research Consulting [**^**](#contents)

<img src="images/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to discover quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure I'm staying on track \ providing value.

I've gathered contact and listing info for the top 200 exchanges, found contact info and areas of interest for academics in crypto, sought the costs and regulations for opening a crypto exchange in various jurisdictions...

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Information Dense Content [**^**](#contents)

<img src="images/information-dense.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I'm quite interested in [creating a series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/comments/apt145/for_hire_i_want_to_write_articles_for_you_about/) of articles on the [history surrounding Bitcoin](https://github.com/infominer33/bitcoin-history). 

**If you want Bitcoin Related Content for your web-site, please [contact](#contact) me.**

If you need content or information related to Self-Sovereign, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identity. Feel free to **[get in touch](#contact)**.
