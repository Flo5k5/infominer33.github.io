**I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming in general, and [data science](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/deep-learning-revolution/).

Though I'm not a developer, my research and content creation has leaned towards more technical subjects, requiring that I become familiar with the general history of software development, it's various branches, and how they inter-relate. 

I *am* planning to learn Python, along with a million other things. Right now, I'm focused on the fundamentals of web development.

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive resource index, for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

That's the lens through which I operate.

You could say that this page is my research resume, proof-of-work, even. Any articles, or resources, linked directly from this page were authored by, yours truly. 

There are also a few transcripts that I cleaned up from youtube's auto-transcribe. So, I got intimate with that content, and created the page it's displayed on, but not the content itself.

I seek out source-grade material, to catalog and record. Making it publically available, for anyone to more easily navigate subjects that I've worked deeply on.

Now that I'm getting my bearings with gh-pages.... 

I have a ton of material ready to be turned into pages. 

This site is gonna be pretty dope. 

## DID-Identity Decentralized [**^**](#information-discovery)

Bitcoin is really my primary interest. However, I've been hired by a number of different parties to write about Blockchain-ID, in quite some depth. So with all of the resources I had collected, it made sense for me to start building a page for it. This is my most highly developed research project, to-date.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zRzLSdR.png)

The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

In my opinion, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency, and will be the first to gain widespread, popular, adoption. Decentralized Identity has a shorter road to mass adoption than the rest of "blockchain" because it has one of the oldest and most mature communities around it.

## Bitcoin History [**^**](#information-discovery)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VhgJcXP.png">

It's called Bitcoin history, because all of this history revolves directly around Bitcoin. Also, I personally identify as a Bitcoiner. It is my intention to understand all of the different fields that have spun-off from bitcoin. First, I must master its history.

## Learn Crypto Trading [**^**](#information-discovery)

Trading \ technical analysis is the subject I've studied the least, of almost anything, but this is my fastest growing repository besides DIDecentralized (surprise surprise). 

My digital transformation tour-guide told me that means it should have a heading here. Jokes aside, I do plan to study more and hope to find some clients who would like content created on the subject. As you'll see, I've already done a decent amount of background research.

## Sourceâ§‰Crypto â€” Research Index Discord Chat [**^**](#information-discovery)

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="images/crypt0library.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I following cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc. â€” re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Sourceâ§‰Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

* [infominer.id/SourceCrypto](https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto)

I've gradually been moving those links from discord to Github in TOML format, to become a database that powers a dynamic web portal.

From there, it's not so hard to spin up [github-pages](/notes.html) for it all. 

All of my work is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 - Public Domain</a>, so others can easily join in. You could even create your own content from what is found here. ðŸ¤“

## Services

I offer ***content creation* and *research consulting*** services.

### Research Consulting [**^**](#information-discovery)

<img src="images/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure I'm providing value.

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Information Dense Content [**^**](#information-discovery)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.

**ISO clients who want Bitcoin-related content for their websites.**

---

One project I'm hoping to find a buyer for is a series of articles on the history surrounding Bitcoin. 

**Rough Outline**
* History of Cryptography:
  * Public Key Encryption (currently only available in books)
  * Hash Algorithms
* Distributed Systems \ Consensus
* History of Cypherpunks
  * History of p2p networking
* History of open source
* History of The Federal Reserve
* History of Digital Currency Before Bitcoin 
* Birth of Bitcoin
* 2012-2016
