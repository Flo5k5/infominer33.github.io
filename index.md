**I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming (at the moment, web development) and data science.

When I say programming, I mean as a subject of content creation, and study. I've studied the general history of software development, learning about it's various branches, and how they inter-relate. 

I am planning to learn Python, along with a million other things. Right now, I'm learning the fundamentals of web-development.

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive resource index, for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

That's the lense through which I operate.

I seek out source-grade material, to catalog and record. Making it publically available, for anyone to more easily navigate subjects that I've worked deeply on.

I have a ton of material ready to be turned into pages. 

Now that I'm getting my bearings with gh-pages.... 

This site is gonna be pretty dope. 

## DID-Identity Decentralized [**^**](#research-index)

![](https://i.imgur.com/zRzLSdR.png)

This is my most highly developed research project, to-date. The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

In my opinion, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency, and will be the first to gain wide adoption. Decentralized Identity has a shorter road to mass adoption than the rest of "blockchain" because it has one of the oldest and most mature communities around it.

## Sourceâ§‰Crypto â€” Research Index Discord Chat [**^**](#research-index)

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="images/crypt0library.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I following cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc â€” re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Sourceâ§‰Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

* [infominer.id/SourceCrypto](https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto)

I've gradually been moving those links from discord to Github in TOML format, to become a database that powers a dynamic web portal.

From there, it's not so hard to spin up [github-pages](/notes.html) for it all.

## Services

I offer ***content creation* and *research consulting*** services.

### Research Consulting [**^**](#research-index)

<img src="images/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure providing value.

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Information Dense Content [**^**](#research-index)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.

**ISO clients who want Bitcoin-related content for their websites.**

One project I'm hoping to find a buyer for is a series of articles on the history surrounding Bitcoin. 

**Rough Outline**
* History of Cryptography:
  * Public Key Encryption (currently only available in books)
  * Hash Algorithms
* Distributed Systems \ Consensus
* History of Cypherpunks
  * History of p2p networking
* History of open source
* History of The Federal Reserve
* History of Digital Currency Before Bitcoin 
* Birth of Bitcoin
* 2012-2016
* 2017
