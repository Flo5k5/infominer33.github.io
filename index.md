**I aim to create content of the highest quality, and relate complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion â€” supplying essential details, with quality sources for additional study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming (at the moment, web development) and data science.

When I say programming, really I don't mean that I'm a developer. I mean I'm interested in it as a subject of content creation. I've studied the general history of development, quite a bit, and am particularly interested in learning Python.

Right now, I'm learning the fundamentals of web-development, which I think is a pretty gentle introduction into that world. 

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive index of the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

That's the lense through which I operate.

In the mean time, I spend a lot of my time learning about various branches of software development, and how they inter-relate.

I seek out source-grade material, to catalog and record. Making it publically available, for anyone to more easily navigate subjects that I've worked deeply on.

I have a ton of material ready to be turned into pages. 

Now that I'm getting my bearings with gh-pages.... 

This site is gonna be pretty dope.

## DID-Identity Decentralized [**^**](#research-index)

This is my most highly developed research project, to-date. The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

In my opinion, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency, and will be the first to gain wide adoption. Decentralized Identity has a shorter road to mass adoption than the rest of "blockchain" because it has one of the oldest and most mature communities around it.

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="images/crypt0library.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I following cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc â€” re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog in the 100+ channels of [â§‰  SuperSource Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

* [infominer.id/SuperSource](https://infominer.id/SuperSource)

I've gradually been moving those links from discord to Github in TOML format, to become a database that powers a dynamic web portal.

From there, it's not so hard to spin up [github-pages](/notes.html) for it all.

## Services

I offer **content creation* and *research consulting** services.

### Research Consulting [**^**](#research-index)

<img src="images/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure providing value.

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Information Dense Content [**^**](#research-index)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.
