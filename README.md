# Readme

I just love learning collecting, organizing and building repositories of information.

Most things I don't read the first time I see them, but save them in the appropriate folder, or re-tweet to catch-up on later.

I usually only learn deeply about a given subject when I have to write about it. I go through all my content on a subject, do some more focused searching, and end up with a much more focused list of resources. Then, once I start putting them in markdown files, it just grows and grows, because it's easy to manage the information with html. 

I've been regularly practicing content creation for over a year now. I've always considered myself a proficient *operator* of personal computers. I never learned programming or any really technical stuff before I found crypto in '17, and had been out of touch with the tech world for quite a while.

I really started getting serious about collecting and organizing information about everything related to crypto about 6 months ago. That's pretty ambitious, I know. 

The thing is... nobody has time to sort through and try to organize the knowledge. Big firms could pay people to do what I do, but there's soooooo many areas of blockcahin you could get involved in.

Well, I'm not that great of a writer, but I'm really good at finding source-grade material and organizing information.

I've always been a big reader, and fact finder... a seeker of truth, since I was young.
