# Information Discovery

<img src="/information-mining.png"/>

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming and related subjects—including data science, quantum computing, and other tech trends. When learning a new subject, I like to begin with a thorough examination of its history. Once I get into a topic I like to organize a large assortment of resources related to it. 

At this point I can afford to be interested in what people will pay me to write about, but am grateful to have a certain amount of creative liberty with the blogs I write for [csbtechemporium.com](https://csbtechemporium.com) and [axiomtech.io](https://axiomtech.io). 

Ultimately, I have plenty of interesting personal projects, and put a lot of effort into everything I work on. So while I'm open to opportunities, the number of clients I'm available to work with is limited.

Do **contact me** if you need content or information related to Self-Sovereign, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identity. (*See [/awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id) and [Hyperledger Indy—Decentralized Identity](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/hyperledger-indy-decentralized-identity)*)

My aim: Create content of the highest quality, relating complex subjects in a concise fashion—supplying essential details, with plenty of references for further study.
