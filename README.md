# Readme

I love learning — and a great way for me to learn, is collecting and organizing information into useful resources\documents. 

The best thing about writing is that I'm not required to remember all of the information I come across. But if I've taken the time to write about it, and research the facts to the best of my ability. Then I always have that knowledge. 

It's hard for me to learn deeply about a subject until I've written about it a few times. The repetitive research process is great. It's always fun to see how I missed so many important things, or I didn't record them atleast.

I've been regularly practicing content creation for over a year now... I've been good w computers, for a while, but never learned to code or any really technical stuff until I found crypto in '17, and had been out of touch with the tech world for quite a while.

I really started getting serious about collecting and cataloging, all information related to crypto, about 6 months ago. I know that's ambitious, but I'm just gonna keep working and see what happens.

I'm not that great of a writer, but I'm good at finding source-grade material, organizing information... and I'm a persistant editor.

I've always been a big reader, and fact finder... seeking to understand what has been made difficult to know.

Really though, anyone could do what I do. 

Independant private-sector research nerds will rise!!! 

well...

Hands on internet research isn't going to get any less important, ok? 

In a world where everything can be automated, and there's more information than anyone knows what to do with. I believe, in the not so distant future, most businesses will have part\full-time internet research staff.

So, I'm just kind of getting the ball rolling.
