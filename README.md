# Information Discovery

<img src="/information-mining.png"/>

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming and related subjects (to a lesser extent data science, quantum computing, and other tech trends). I like collect and organize an assortment of resources related to subjects that interest me. 

At this point I can afford to be interested in what people will pay me to write about, but I'm not a shill. Ultimately, I have plenty of interesting personal projects, and put a lot of effort into everything I work on. So while I'm open to opportunities, the number of clients I'm available to work with is limited.

Do **contact me** if you need content or information related to Self-Sovereign, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identity. (*See [/awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id) and [Hyperledger Indy—Decentralized Identity](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/hyperledger-indy-decentralized-identity)*)

I'm also very interested in creating a series of blog posts about the history surrounding Bitcoin. If you want Bitcoin content on your site, please contact me. My rates are negotiable.

My aim: Create content of the highest quality, relating complex subjects in a concise fashion—supplying essential details, with quality resources for additional study.
